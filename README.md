## Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using HTML CSS and JavaScript. It's a simple and fun game where you control a snake, guiding it to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

### Features

- **Responsive Canvas:** The game is displayed on an HTML5 canvas element, making it responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Scoring System:** Your current score is displayed in real-time as you collect food items. Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible!

- **Reset Button:** If you make a wrong move or want to start a new game, simply click the "Reset" button to restart the game.

### Getting Started

To play the game or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open `index.html`:** Launch the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. **Game Controls:** Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement (up, down, left, and right).

### How to Play

- Control the snake to collect the food items that appear on the canvas.
- As the snake consumes food, it grows longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls of the game board or running into the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
- Try to achieve the highest score by eating as much food as possible before the game ends.
